# Julia Code

This folder contains the Jupyter Notebook (`juliacon.ipynb`) with the code behind the JuliaCon talk "Prototyping Visualizations for the Web with Vega and Julia".  The presentation is also included.

The notebook should be run in Jupyter Lab to ensure the plots are interactive.  If the plots are not responding (static image), try installing the latest jupyter lab vega extension.

```
jupyter labextension install @jupyterlab/vega5-extension
```
