# JuliaCon2019 - Prototyping Visualizations for the Web with Vega and Julia

This web app was developed for JuliaCon 2019 in Baltimore, MD as part of the lightning talk "Prototyping Visualizations for the Web with Vega and Julia" by [Mary McGrath](https://github.com/mcmcgrath13). Julia was used for web scraping, data wrangling, natural language processing, and designing visualizations (with the help of DataVoyager) - see the `julia` folder for the Jupyter Notebook. Visualization specifications were then copied to this React App and interactions between the two figures added.
